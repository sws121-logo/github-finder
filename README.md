# GitHub User Finder Application

## Overview

The **GitHub User Finder** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view details such as repositories, followers, and more. The app integrates with the GitHub API and provides a smooth, user-friendly interface for searching GitHub users by their usernames.

This application is designed using **React**, with state management implemented via **Context API**. It also uses **React Router** for seamless navigation between different pages of the application, and **Axios** for API requests to GitHub. The goal of the project is to demonstrate React fundamentals, including routing, state management, and API integration.

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- Provide users with the ability to search for GitHub profiles.
- Fetch and display detailed information about users such as repositories, followers, and more.
- Demonstrate the effective use of **React**, **Context API**, **React Router**, and external APIs.
- Present a clean, responsive, and modern UI.

## Features

- **Search GitHub Users**: Allows users to search GitHub profiles by username.
- **Profile View**: Displays detailed information about a specific GitHub user, including their repositories, followers, and other data.
- **Alert System**: Alerts users when no search query is entered or if an error occurs.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, providing a great user experience across devices.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a custom 404 page for invalid URLs.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different routes.
- **Context API**: For global state management across the application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS to style the application.

### Backend:
- **GitHub API**: The application integrates with the GitHub API to fetch user data.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Install

    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    In the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GitHub Client ID and Client Secret:
    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
    REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    Start the development server using:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Key Components:

- **NavBar**: Displays the navigation bar with links to Home, About, and other routes.
- **Home**: The landing page that includes the search functionality.
- **User**: Displays detailed information about a GitHub user.
- **Alert**: Shows alert messages when necessary (e.g., if a user does not enter a search term).
- **NotFound**: A custom 404 page for invalid routes.
- **GithubState**: Handles GitHub-related state management using Context API.
- **AlertState**: Handles the alert system's state management using Context API.

## Usage

1. **Search GitHub Users**: Enter a GitHub username into the search bar on the home page.
2. **View User Details**: Click on a user from the search results to view their detailed profile information, including repositories, followers, and more.
3. **Navigate Pages**: Use the navigation bar to visit the About page or return to the Home page.

## API Reference

The application interacts with the **GitHub API** to fetch user details. The main API endpoints used include:
- **GET** `/search/users`: For searching users by their GitHub username.
- **GET** `/users/:login`: For retrieving detailed profile information for a specific user.

You need to obtain **GitHub Client ID** and **Client Secret** to authenticate your API requests. These can be set in your `.env` file.

## Future Improvements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large search results to improve performance.
- **Dark Mode**: Add dark mode functionality for a better user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to manage API rate limits and network issues.
- **Profile Customization**: Add the ability for users to customize their profile view.
